CSS Layout and Positioning

CSS Positioning.

    - static (default): Elements are positioned according to normal document flow.

    - relative: Positions an element relative to its normal position, allowing top, right, bottom, left to create an offset.
    
    - fixed: Positions an element relative to the viewport, so it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

    - absolute: Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the document body if no ancestor is positioned).

    - sticky: Toggles between relative and fixed based on the element's position in the viewport.
